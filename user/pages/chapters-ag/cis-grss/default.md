### GRSS Summer School - 9-13 July 2018

A 5-day Remote Sensing workshop/summer school is to be held Monday-Friday, July 9-13 on the campus of Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS.  This is the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) annual summer school. The intensive workshop is designed to jumpstart a student or professional who is relatively new to the field of remote sensing and particularly for scientists who want to utilize remote sensing technologies.  This year’s workshop will have seminars and hands-on sessions with UAVs and agricultural analysis, so that is very exciting.

The summer school is held each year during the days  just prior to the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS).  While IGARSS typically has 1500-2000 attendees, we typically only have about 50-60 students and young professionals participate in the summer school, so they get a lot of one-on-one attention from the leading experts we bring in to teach the sessions.  It is VERY affordable ($100 registration), so it is a great opportunity to add on a few days of intensive learning before the IGARSS conference or as a stand-alone activity on its own. Student housing is VERY inexpensive ($45/night – single; $30/night double), and we encourage attendees to take advantage of this opportunity.
This highly useful program giving insights into UAVs, remote sensing sensors and their applications to agricultural analysis.

### Educational Activities 2018 - Graduate Student Research Grants

The IEEE CIS is inviting applications for funding opportunity, for deserving undergraduate, graduate and PhD students who need financial support to carry out their research during an academic break period. Any student with a meritorious project is invited to apply, but scholarships will be granted only to applicants who are student members of the IEEE CIS and students at the time the scholarship is awarded.  
The primary intent of these scholarships is to cover the expenses related to a visit to another university, institute or research agency for collaboration with an identified researcher in the field of interest of the applicant. Funds can be used to cover travel expenses as well as certain living expenses (such as housing). The field of interest of applicants is open, but should be connected with identifiable component of the CIS (neural networks, fuzzy systems, or evolutionary computation).
The amount of a CIS scholarship varies from $1,000 to $4,000. We expect to award 3-5 scholarships, but it depends on the budget approved by CIS ADCOM. Deadline for submission of applications is Mar 15, 2018. Please refer to the details or contact Bing.Xue@ecs.vuw.ac.nz.

Space Applications Centre (SAC) has been playing an important role in utilizing space technology through its various applications for socio-economic development of the country. The centre is responsible for the development, realization and qualification of the payloads and related ground systems in the areas of communications, broadcasting, earth observations including remote sensing of natural resources, weather and environmental monitoring, etc. SAC is also a host institution for the training programs related to Satellite Communication and Meteorology activities of the Centre for Space Science & Technology Education in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP) affiliated to the United Nations (UN).

IEEE  Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society provides research and expert interaction opportunities and access to information on  the theory, concepts, and techniques of science and engineering as they apply to the remote sensing of the earth, oceans, atmosphere, and space, as well as the processing, interpretation and dissemination of this information. IEEE GRSS has established six local chapters in India namely Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bombay, Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata (<http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/chapters>). For membership, please follow the site at <https://www.ieee.org/membership>.

NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) is being developed jointly by JPL/NASA and ISRO. While ISRO is developing S-band SAR, NASA/JPL is working for the development of L-band SAR. The L- and S- band SAR data from this satellite would be  useful for a variety of applications including soil moisture and crop monitoring <https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov>; <http://www.sac.gov.in/nisar>. Thus, it is appropriate to create awareness on the use of SAR for soil moisture and crop monitoring using available SAR data from various missions.

Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is an American environmental research satellite launched on 31 January 2015. SMAP is designed to measure soil moisture over a three-year period, every 2-3 days. This permits changes, around the world, to be observed over time scales ranging from major storms to repeated measurements of changes over the seasons.(<https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov>)

### Project name: GRSS Student Grand Challenge

**Proposed by:** Adriano Camps

**Contact name:** David Kunkee

**Project description:**

This proposal is for a one and a half year project intended to engage students and young professionals in solving a complex engineering problem within the scope of GRSS and other sister societies (e.g., Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Antenna Propagation, Ocean Engineering, Computer, Microwave Theory and Techniques). Student chapters DO NOT have to be formed at the time of submitting the proposal, but if selected, they commit to form it before the end of the current year.

The "grand challenge" is to design and implement an end-to-end observing system based on drones or RPAS to address a problem linked to strategic themes like the observation of the polar regions, precision farming, forest monitoring, desertification. This should include the definition of the problem to be addressed, the techniques that will be used, the instrument concept that will be implemented, the data storage/transmission system AND an smart phone app to display the results interactively.

**Important dates:**

- May 15, 2018: teams willing to participate must send a brief description of their mission concept (< 10 pages), indicating: team description, feasibility study of the proposed mission concept, budget proposal (budget can be higher than 6K$ but GRSS request must be less than 6K$. If the proposing team is not yet part of an already established GRSS Student Chapter, it is important that commitment to form a new Chapter by the end of 2018 be included in the proposal. Proposals should be sent to David Kunkee (david.b.kunkee@aero.org).

- June 15, 2018: announcement of the 5 selected teams. Selected teams will receive 6K$ to implement the system, and to travel to attend IGARSS

- 2019 in Yokohama (Japan) to present their results in a dedicated oral half session.

### First Richard Moore Memorial Lecture by Dr. Paul A. Rosen, JPL, NASA and Fellow IEEE

#### Topic: Innovations in synthetic aperture radar: past, present and future  

**Abstract:** The age ofspaceborne radar remote sensing was born in 1978 with the launch of SEASAT, an experimental satellite carry an array of microwave instruments − a radiometer, an altimeter, and a synthetic aperture radar. SEASAT demonstrated in its short lifespan theuniqueness and utility of radar’s all−weather day/night capabilities and led to a sustained and accelerating international growth in the number and variety of radar instrumentsthat are orbiting Earth and the planets. Unlike optical sensors, radarsees the electrical and structural properties of an object and therefore give us a view of worlds that is quite different from our everyday experience.

With wavelengthsthatspan a range from millimetersto kilometers, radars can scatterfrom ice crystals in clouds as well as penetrate deep into ice crusts of planetary objects. Spacefaring nations consider Earth imaging radar to be critical to theirscientific and operational needs, and a growing number of systems are being launched around the world. The volume of radar data being acquired of Earth is growing rapidly as the benefits of continuous time−series around the globe are becoming apparent.

Sophisticated techniques in change detection and quantitative geodesy using interferometric and polarimetric methods are revolutionizing the fields of solid earth science, glaciology, and ecosystems science, among others. Radar altimeters operationally measure ocean topography,mm−wavelength radarsounders profile cloud and precipitation, and scatterometers determine oceanwinds.

These data are becoming essential climate records, with a scientific imperative for continuing measurements. With the availability of low−cost space−qualified digital hardware,radars are becomingmore flexible,more capable, and less expensive per unit area observed. Along with the standardization of cubesats and smallspacecraG, many companies are now planning dense constellations ofradarsatellites to feed the growing commercial market for radar imagery. In addition to facility−class missions are becoming more capable and flexible collecting petabytes of data each year. This will only grow in the future. In this talk, an overview of the major developments in spaceborne radar systems will be presented, highlighting the intersections of science and innovation in spaceborne radar developments, including some of the most interesting science and technology achievements obtained over the years, and describe upcoming initiatives that support future directions in Earth and planetary observations.
