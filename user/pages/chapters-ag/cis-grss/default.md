### GRSS Summer School - 9-13 July 2018

A 5-day Remote Sensing workshop/summer school is to be held Monday-Friday, July 9-13 on the campus of Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS.  This is the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) annual summer school. The intensive workshop is designed to jumpstart a student or professional who is relatively new to the field of remote sensing and particularly for scientists who want to utilize remote sensing technologies.  This year’s workshop will have seminars and hands-on sessions with UAVs and agricultural analysis, so that is very exciting.

The summer school is held each year during the days  just prior to the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS).  While IGARSS typically has 1500-2000 attendees, we typically only have about 50-60 students and young professionals participate in the summer school, so they get a lot of one-on-one attention from the leading experts we bring in to teach the sessions.  It is VERY affordable ($100 registration), so it is a great opportunity to add on a few days of intensive learning before the IGARSS conference or as a stand-alone activity on its own. Student housing is VERY inexpensive ($45/night – single; $30/night double), and we encourage attendees to take advantage of this opportunity.
This highly useful program giving insights into UAVs, remote sensing sensors and their applications to agricultural analysis.

### Project name: GRSS Student Grand Challenge

**Proposed by:** Adriano Camps

**Contact name:** David Kunkee

**Project description:**

This proposal is for a one and a half year project intended to engage students and young professionals in solving a complex engineering problem within the scope of GRSS and other sister societies (e.g., Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Antenna Propagation, Ocean Engineering, Computer, Microwave Theory and Techniques). Student chapters DO NOT have to be formed at the time of submitting the proposal, but if selected, they commit to form it before the end of the current year.

The "grand challenge" is to design and implement an end-to-end observing system based on drones or RPAS to address a problem linked to strategic themes like the observation of the polar regions, precision farming, forest monitoring, desertification. This should include the definition of the problem to be addressed, the techniques that will be used, the instrument concept that will be implemented, the data storage/transmission system AND an smart phone app to display the results interactively.

**Important dates:**

- May 15, 2018: teams willing to participate must send a brief description of their mission concept (< 10 pages), indicating: team description, feasibility study of the proposed mission concept, budget proposal (budget can be higher than 6K$ but GRSS request must be less than 6K$. If the proposing team is not yet part of an already established GRSS Student Chapter, it is important that commitment to form a new Chapter by the end of 2018 be included in the proposal. Proposals should be sent to David Kunkee (david.b.kunkee@aero.org).

- June 15, 2018: announcement of the 5 selected teams. Selected teams will receive 6K$ to implement the system, and to travel to attend IGARSS

### First Richard Moore Memorial Lecture by Dr. Paul A. Rosen, JPL, NASA and Fellow IEEE

#### Topic: Innovations in synthetic aperture radar: past, present and future  

**Abstract:** The age ofspaceborne radar remote sensing was born in 1978 with the launch of SEASAT, an experimental satellite carry an array of microwave instruments − a radiometer, an altimeter, and a synthetic aperture radar. SEASAT demonstrated in its short lifespan theuniqueness and utility of radar’s all−weather day/night capabilities and led to a sustained and accelerating international growth in the number and variety of radar instrumentsthat are orbiting Earth and the planets. Unlike optical sensors, radarsees the electrical and structural properties of an object and therefore give us a view of worlds that is quite different from our everyday experience.

With wavelengthsthatspan a range from millimetersto kilometers, radars can scatterfrom ice crystals in clouds as well as penetrate deep into ice crusts of planetary objects. Spacefaring nations consider Earth imaging radar to be critical to theirscientific and operational needs, and a growing number of systems are being launched around the world. The volume of radar data being acquired of Earth is growing rapidly as the benefits of continuous time−series around the globe are becoming apparent.

Sophisticated techniques in change detection and quantitative geodesy using interferometric and polarimetric methods are revolutionizing the fields of solid earth science, glaciology, and ecosystems science, among others. Radar altimeters operationally measure ocean topography,mm−wavelength radarsounders profile cloud and precipitation, and scatterometers determine oceanwinds.

These data are becoming essential climate records, with a scientific imperative for continuing measurements. With the availability of low−cost space−qualified digital hardware,radars are becomingmore flexible,more capable, and less expensive per unit area observed. Along with the standardization of cubesats and smallspacecraG, many companies are now planning dense constellations ofradarsatellites to feed the growing commercial market for radar imagery. In addition to facility−class missions are becoming more capable and flexible collecting petabytes of data each year. This will only grow in the future. In this talk, an overview of the major developments in spaceborne radar systems will be presented, highlighting the intersections of science and innovation in spaceborne radar developments, including some of the most interesting science and technology achievements obtained over the years, and describe upcoming initiatives that support future directions in Earth and planetary observations.

#### Webinar on "The Social and Ethical Implications Of Computational Intelligence" ####

Computational Intelligence  Society (CIS) is organizing a webinar and please find the details below:

**Webinar Speaker:** Dr Matt Garratt, University of New South Wales

**Webinar Title:** The Social and Ethical Implications Of Computational Intelligence

**Date:** Thu, May 17, 2018 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM IST

**Registration link:** <https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2071141647237678337>

**Abstract**: Computational Intelligence (CI) is a term encompassing a basket of soft-computing methodologies used to solve problems that are not suited to solution by mathematical or other traditional methods. CI techniques include technologies such as fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, deep learning, evolutionary computation and cognitive and developmental systems. Today, CI techniques are embodied within many technologies ranging from autonomous driverless cars to automated decision making on the stock exchange. These technologies already have a significant positive effect on the global economy and when used properly can greatly enhance the lives of many people. There are however risks with misuse of CI. In this webinar, we will discuss what the moral principles should be that govern the behaviour of CI technology, as well as the designer. These principles cover balancing the ecological footprint of technologies against the economic benefits, managing the impact of automation on the workforce, ensuring privacy is not adversely affected and dealing with the legal implications of embodying CI technologies in autonomous systems.

**Speaker Bio:** Matthew A Garratt received a BE degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Sydney University, Australia, a graduate diploma in applied computer science from Central Queensland University  and a PhD in the field of biologically inspired robotics from the Australian National University in 2008. Prior to entering academia, Matt worked as an engineer in the Royal Australian Navy for a decade. Some of his research successes include demonstration of terrain following using vision for an unmanned helicopter, landing an unmanned helicopter onto a moving deck simulator and control of helicopters using neural networks. Some of his current research projects include achieving autonomous flight in cluttered environments using monocular cameras and range sensors, landing UAVs on moving platforms, adaptive flight control for flapping wing and rotary wing vehicles, trusted human-autonomy teaming in teleoperations and self-organising Unmanned Systems in contested RF environments. He is an Associate professor with the School of Engineering and Information Technology (SEIT) at the University of New South Wales, Canberra. Matt is currently the Deputy Head of School (Research) in SEIT and is the chair of the Computational Intelligence Society task force on the Ethics and Social Implications of CI.
