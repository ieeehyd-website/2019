#### IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc)

ComSoc promotes the advancement of science, technology and applications in
communications and related disciplines. It fosters presentation and exchange of
information among its members and the technical community throughout the world.
The Society maintains the highest standard of professionalism and technical
competency.
ComSoc fosters original work in all aspects of communications science, engineering,
and technology. It encourages the development of applications that use signals to
transfer voice, data, image, and/or video information between locations
This Society promotes the theory and use of systems involving all types of terminals,
computers, and information processors; all pertinent systems and operations that
facilitate transfer; all transmission media; switched and unswitched networks; and
network layouts, protocols, architectures, and implementations

#### IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS)

Signal processing is the enabling technology for the generation, transformation,
extraction, and interpretation of information. It comprises the theory, algorithms with
associated architectures and implementations, and applications related to processing
information contained in many different formats broadly designated as signals. Signal
processing uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and/or linguistic
representations, formalisms, modeling techniques and algorithms for generating,
transforming, transmitting, and learning from signals.
The Signal Processing Society is an international organization whose purpose is to:
advance and disseminate state-of- the-art scientific information and resources; educate
the signal processing community; and provide a venue for people to interact and
exchange ideas.
